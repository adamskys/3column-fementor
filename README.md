## Overview

I've learned how to build easy 3-column component. I've used SASS for the first time and I hope that code doesn't look that bad.
I've struggled with button positioning when resizing window and I'd need to fix that (tips on that would be helpful).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

Creating easy component using SASS (partially).

### Continued development

Learning more SASS as it looks as step up in writing CSS, taking care of positioning more. It wasn't that bad this time, however I can see that buttons are moving regardless the design.
